    use  php bin/console doctrine:generate:entity

then make associations:
http://symfony.com/doc/current/doctrine/associations.html
make associations in yml file
mappedBy = field
inversedBy = private variable (on the one side, auto generated) holding the manies
    possibility: the @joinColumn can be ommitted, defaults created
        name = name of column for this (many) side??
        referencedColumnName = name of column on the other (one) side??
then do
php bin/console doctrine:generate:entities AppBundle
to generate new entity files (don't think I have to manually update __construct() if using this)
